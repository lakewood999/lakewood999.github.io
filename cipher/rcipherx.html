        <h2>R-Cipher X</h2>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>R Cipher X is a version of the R cipher, designed by me which can have an infinitely long key.  The cipher is written in Python, and can be found in the Cipher project.  A link to that repository can be found on the Projects page.</p>
        <h3>Cipher Method</h3>
        <p>Coming Soon!</p>
        <h3>Commands/How To Use</h3>
        <p>A live example can be found, <a href="https://repl.it/CCNT/111">here</a>.  R-cipher x has 2 commands.  After loading the module, type in rcipherx('encrypt'), to get the prompt to encrypt a message.  You have to ener lower-case letters, or elese this will not work.  To decrypt a message, use the command rcipherx('decrypt').  Again, you have to eneter lower case letters.  If you need more help, please create an issue, in the Cipher repository.</p>

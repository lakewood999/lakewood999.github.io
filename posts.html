        <b><h3>New Page!!</h3></b>
        <p>Hi everyone!  It's been a long time since I have posted, but I will be making a new page.  It's basically a music system  that let's you listen to music while you work.  I won't be using actual mp3s, but youtube videos.  I won't get into the specifics, but I will probably start working on it on Thursday, or 3/24.  I have been pretty busy lately, so I havn't been able to do much.</p>

        <b><h3>PRPP</h3></b>
        <p>     Hi everyone!  As your can see on my Github Page, I have a new project called PRPP.  This place will hold the answers and info for PRPP problems.  Visit the PRPP tab on my page if you haven't already.  There will be more information there, and I will posts links to problems and answers on that page.  See you guys later, and watch out for the first PRPP problem.  Also, the Servesium project will be up soon.  I have promised this before, and it still hasn't happened yet.  I have been very busy recently.<br>-lakewood999</p>

        <b><h3>Servesium, and Python Module</h3></b>
        <p>Hi everyone!  This is an update on my two other modules.  I promise to get Servesium done as fast as I can.  The source code is done and just needs to be tweaked and uploaded.  I will create a wiki on this site, and on the individual project page.  About the python module, there is a PRE-RELEASE on the repo page.  It's not done yet, aand that is just a rough version.  Some things may not work.  I have a couple more planned features to the module.  I will make a post once I get a full release, or at least a Beta going.</p>

        <b><h3>News</h3></b>
        <p>Hi guys, as you see, we have a total of 3 repositories on our account.  Servesium, we have talked about before, and this one is oviously for this website.  We now have a new repository that goes something like "rc-python-module".  This will be a repository for an add-on to you existing python builds.  It's just full of extra commands and tool.  Note that this module is not for use with new code.  It is simply a module full of COMMANDS that are available to use.  We are devloping a method to install it.  Currently, the code is on repl.it.  A link will be posted to it.  We will put the code onto Github, though.  The Servesium repository is still being created.  Core files, as well as additionaly add-ons will be included in that repository.  A template for the blog like this one, is an add-on.  Once we have the link to the repl site, we will post it here as an update.  More to come soon!  Also, go to repl.it for a great environment to test code.  It is completely free, and has various different languages that are supported.  <a href="https://repl.it/languages" target="_blank">Repl</a>  This is not an affiliate link.  I am, in no wat supported by giving this link.  Anyways, check it out!</p>

        <b><h3>Hooray!</h3></b>
        <p>Hooray! This website is finally up!  I want to thank Github for having Github Pages, which is what this website is hosted on.  This site is the main page for my other projects, and will be my personal page.  I think I will put a redirect, so that it is "impossible" to reach the http version of this page.  About Github pages, if you haven't made a website through Github pages, you can find out how to do so <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.  You can use their website builder, if you don't know HTML and CSS.</p>

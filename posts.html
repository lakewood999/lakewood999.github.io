        <p>Here, you can find posts on updates, and other items.  Sometimes, there will just be small talk.  Visit this page for the most recent info and upcoming events! Enjoy!  P.S.  Posts will contain more details about the Message of the Day.  The "goals" table on the Home page will be deprecated, and information found in that table will be found here.  Thank you.</p>

        <p>It's official everyone, servesium.net is live!  It will be updated at least twice each week with the latest version of this website.  Keep in mind that servesium.com:8000 will always have the real, live version of the page.  Servesium.com will eventually be the official live website, once this chromebook, the one that this website is running on, starts running Ubuntu.  That will be coming soon.  In the meantime, we are developing a comment section requiring javascript.  A clock will also be running on the home page.  The clock is running military time.  More styling will be done to make the pages look better.  Again, as we are working on the comments section, please email requests and messages to lakewood999@gmail.com.  Thank you all for you support, and enjoy the site.  P.S. A github website will be ready soon.</p>

        <b><h3>Updates and Information</h3></b>
        <p>Hi guys!  We are hoping to be able to start another webserver, so we have a webserver running at all times.  This may not happen though.  If we do so, the URL would be servesium.net, and without a port!(It is hosted on port 80, so you wouldn't need to type it in)  Also, we hope to make this webpage dynamic, so it can be updated anywhere.  This is in progress.  Otherwise, enjoy the site!  We will start migrating the "plans" table from the Home page here.</p>
        <p><b>Update(6:02pm):</b>We have added a cookie and a system that warns mobile users about screen orientation.  Please email your opinion to lakewood999@gmail.com</p>

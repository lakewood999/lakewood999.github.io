        <b><h3>News</h3></b>
        <p>Hi guys, as you see, we have a total of 3 repositories on our account.  Servesium, we have talked about before, and this one is oviously for this website.  We now have a new repository that goes something like "rc-python-module".  This will be a repository for an add-on to you existing python builds.  It's just full of extra commands and tool.  Note that this module is not for use with new code.  It is simply a module full of COMMANDS that are available to use.  We are devloping a method to install it.  Currently, the code is on repl.it.  A link will be posted to it.  We will put the code onto Github, though.  The Servesium repository is still being created.  Core files, as well as additionaly add-ons will be included in that repository.  A template for the blog like this one, is an add-on.  Once we have the link to the repl site, we will post it here as an update.  More to come soon!  Also, go to repl.it for a great environment to test code.  It is completely free, and has various different languages that are supported.  <a href="https://repl.it/languages" target="_blank">Repl</a>  This is not an affiliate link.  I am, in no wat supported by giving this link.  Anyways, check it out!</p>

        <b><h3>Hooray!</h3></b>
        <p>Hooray! This website is finally up!  I want to thank Github for having Github Pages, which is what this website is hosted on.  This site is the main page for my other projects, and will be my personal page.  I think I will put a redirect, so that it is "impossible" to reach the http version of this page.  About Github pages, if you haven't made a website through Github pages, you can find out how to do so <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.  You can use their website builder, if you don't know HTML and CSS.</p>
